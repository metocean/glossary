# Dew point temperature

The *dew point* (or *dewpoint*) is the temperature at which dew forms and is a measure of atmospheric moisture.

It is the temperature to which air must be cooled at constant pressure and water content to reach saturation. A **higher dew point indicates more moisture in the air**; a dew point greater than 68째F (20째C) is considered uncomfortable and greater than 72째F (22째C) is considered to be extremely humid.
