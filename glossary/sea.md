description: Part of the sea state that is being actively generated by the wind

#Sea
The sea part of a [sea state](?sea-state) refers to the waves that are actively responding to the wind at the current location. Sea waves are short cressed and come from a range of angles. In stronger winds sea waves will whitecap and may become steep.

The size of the local sea is dependent on the strength of the wind, the [fetch](?fetch) and the time the wind has been blowing. Once the wind starts to blow, the waves increase in size, and seas are said to be 'rising'. If winds are persistent over a particular fetch, a condition may occur where the waves no longer increase in size and the sea state is said to 'saturated'. Following a decrease of windspeed, waves will decrease in size and seas are said to 'ease' or 'moderate'.

Sea can be confused during rapidly changing wind conditions as waves are generated from multiple directions. the combination of sea and [swell](?swell) from different directions can also lead to a confused sea state.

Through [spectral partitioning](?spectral-partitioning), the sea can be separated from other parts of the sea state and given specific quantitative values of [significant wave height](?significant-wave-height), [mean wave direction](?mean-wave-direction) and [peak period](?peak-period).
