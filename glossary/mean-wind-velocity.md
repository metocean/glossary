#Mean wind velocity
Mean wind velocity describes the wind either as (usually) speed and direction or as east and north vector components. The wind velocity is given for refernce height, commonly 10 m above surface level. The averaging period for the wind speed is typically 10 minutes, so the mean wind speed will be less than instantaneous gust speeds.

Wind velocity can be expressed at any reference level above the surface, with wind speeds usually becoming higher with height.
