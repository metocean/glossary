description: Risk of thunderstorm activity based on atmospheric stability

# Thunderstorm Risk
A rough estimate of the probability of thunderstorms or tropical squalls can be made from a bulk indicator of atmospheric stability.
These indicators can be based on Convectively Available Potential Energy (CAPE) or Lifted Index (LI).
In MetOceanView, the following criteria are used to determine the risk of thunderstorms or squalls:
- CAPE>1000 OR LI<-2: Moderate
- CAPE>2500 OR LI<-5: High
