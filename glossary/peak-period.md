description:The period of waves with most energy in a sea state or wave partition

#Peak period
The peak period is the wave period of the most energetic waves in a sea state or [partition](?spectral-partition) of the sea state. In the case of [swell](?swell), this will correspond closely to the time between successive wave crests arriving at a fixed point. For [sea](?sea), this is less easy to observe directly but will correspond roughly to the time between arrival of the larger waves.

Mathematically, the spectral peak period, $$T_p$$ is the inverse of the frequency at the highest point in the one dimensional [wave spectrum](?wave-spectrum):
$$T_p=\frac{1}{\arg\!\max \int^{pi}_{-pi} E(f,\theta) d\theta}$$
