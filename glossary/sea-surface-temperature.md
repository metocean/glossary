title: Sea surface temperature
units: centigrade
description: Temperature of the surface layer of the ocean

# Sea surface temperature (SST)
The temperature of the top layer of the ocean. The exact reference depth of the surface layer depends on the origin of the data. 
For satellite estimates, the SST is radiating temperature of the top skin of the ocean. For model derived forecasts SST, it is typically 
model temperature values of the top model layer. The amount of horizontal structure observable depends on the model resolution or the interpolation method of the satellite estimates. 

The gridded satellite product displayed in the MetOceanView map overlays has 1km resolution. For the model forecast SST layer it depends on the local resolution of the model grid.
