title: Long wave

#Long wave
Long waves are created when swell waves interact with the coast and result in water level oscillations with periods much longer than the original swell waves. At most sites there are two distinct long wave bands with significant energy peaks; termed the infragravity (IG) and far infragravity (FIG). The exact division between these two bands varies slightly with location. These two long wave bands are driven by the incident swell but have different characteristics and resultant effects on marine operations. 

IG waves (infragravity waves) are typically generated in the surf zone by the wave breaking process, modulated by wave groups and can be correlated with swell wave parameters. They have typical periods ranging between 25 and 200 seconds and in many locations, they are also modulated by the tide level (e.g., they are higher at high tide). 

FIG waves (far infragravity waves) are also generated by wave groups but with a longer timescale than IG waves. They can be released into a harbour as the group passes the entrance or reflected from the coastline. They have typical periods ranging between 2 and 60 minutes. They can also be correlated with the swell wave parameters but are not usually modulated by the tide level.
