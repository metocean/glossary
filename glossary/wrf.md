# WRF

WRF is a numerical weather prediction (NWP) system designed to serve both atmospheric research and operational forecasting needs.
WRF features two dynamical (computational) cores (or solvers), a data assimilation system, and a software architecture allowing for parallel computation and system extensibility.
The model serves a wide range of meteorological applications across scales ranging from meters to thousands of kilometres.

WRF provides operational forecasting a flexible and robust platform, while offering advances in physics, numeric, and data assimilation contributed by the many research community developers.
WRF is currently in operational use at NCEP and other forecasting centers internationally.
WRF has grown to have a large worldwide community of users (over 30,000 registered users in over 150 countries), and workshops and tutorials are held each year at NCAR.
WRF is used extensively for research and real-time forecasting throughout the world.

WRF offers two dynamical solvers for its computation of the atmospheric governing equations, and the variants of the model are known as WRF-ARW (Advanced Research WRF) and WRF-NMM (non-hydrostatic mesoscale model).
The Advanced Research WRF (ARW) is supported to the community by the NCAR Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology Division.
The WRF-NMM solver variant was based on the Eta model, and later non-hydrostatic mesoscale model, developed at NCEP.
The WRF-NMM (NMM) is supported to the community by the Developmental Testbed Center (DTC).
