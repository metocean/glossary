title: ROMS

# ROMS

ROMS is a 3D primitive equations ocean model using hydrostatic and Boussinesq approximations. Essentially, the model calculates the solutions for sea surface height, 3D currents and 3D temperature and salinity fields for the given forcing fields and boundary conditions. Forcing fields include, for instance, tides and atmospheric drivers, such as winds, sea level pressure and air-sea heat exchanges. The boundary conditions allows the model to receive information from another wider domain, coarser resolution model. The model terrain-following coordinate system is a benefit in regions of large bathymetry variations, solving all depth-dependent variables within the same number of vertical layers independently of the local depth.
