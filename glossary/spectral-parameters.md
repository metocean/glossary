description:Single numbers describing aspects of the sea state

#Spectral Parameters
Spectral parameters are calculated from the [wave spectrum](?wave-spectrum) and are single numbers which characterise aspects of the [sea state](?sea-state). Examples are:
* [Significant wave height](?significant-wave-height)
* [Peak period](?peak-period)
* [Mean wave direction](?mean-wave-direction)

Spectral parameters can be calculated for the complete sea state or for parts such as the [sea](?sea) or [swell](?swell) that have separated by [spectral partitioning](?spectral-partitioning).
