unit: hs
description: Significant wave height is the average of the top one-third highest waves

# Significant Wave Height

Significant wave height is defined in one of two ways:
1. The average height of the largest one-third waves in a zero-crossing analysis
2. A function of the energy in the full or partial wave spectrum:


The zero-crossing significant wave height was originally defined to correspond to the height of waves as estimated by a trained observer at sea.

$$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$
