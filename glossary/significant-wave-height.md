description: Significant wave height is the average of the top one-third highest waves

# Significant Wave Height

Significant wave height, $$H_s$$ is defined in one of two ways:
1. The average height of the largest one-third waves in a zero-crossing analysis
2. A function of the energy in the full or partial [wave spectrum](wave-spectrum), $$E(f,\theta)$$:
  
  $$ H_s=4\sqrt{\int^\pi_{-\pi} E(f,\theta) df d\theta} $$

The two definitions are usually very close in a typical sea state.

The zero-crossing significant wave height was originally defined to correspond to the height of waves as estimated by a trained observer at sea.
