title: SWAN

# SWAN

SWAN is a third-generation ocean wave propagation model which solves the spectral action density balance equation (Booij et al., 1999).
The model simulates the growth, refraction and decay of each frequency-direction component of the complete sea state, providing a realistic description of the wave field as it changes in time and space.
Physical processes that can be modelled include the generation of waves by surface wind, dissipation by white-capping, resonant nonlinear interaction between the wave components, bottom friction and depth-induced wave breaking dissipation.
A detailed description of the model equations, parametrisations and numerical schemes can be found in (Holthuijsen et al., 2007) and in the SWAN documentation[1].
