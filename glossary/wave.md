**Wave period**
Wave Period is the time interval (in seconds) between the passage of successive crests past a fixed point. The time for a wave crest to traverse a distance equal to one wavelength. 

Check the definition of [peak period](peak-period). 

**Wave height** 
Wave height (H), is the difference in surface elevation between the wave crest and the previous wave trough. 

Check the definition of [significant wave height](significant-wave-height). 

**Wave direction**
The direction from which a wave approaches (degrees clockwise from True North). 

Check the definition of [mean wave direction](mean-wave-direction).
