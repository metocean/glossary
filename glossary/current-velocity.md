description: Current velocity at a reference level

# Current velocity
Current velocity describes the current either as (usually) speed and direction or as east and north vector components.
The direction is usually expressed as direction the current is flowing to, and this is the convention used in MetOceanView.
The current velocity is given for reference level below sea surface or as a mean over a vertical slab of ocean, sometimes the whole depth.


Current velocity can be expressed at any reference level below the surface, with currents speeds typically lower deeper in the ocean.
