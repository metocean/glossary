description: Current velocity at a reference level

# Current velocity
Current velocity describes the current either as (usually) speed and direction or (less commonly) as east and north vector components.
Current direction is normally expressed as direction the current is flowing to, and this is the convention used in MetOceanView.
The current velocity is given for reference level below sea surface or as a mean over a vertical slab of ocean, sometimes the entire water depth.


Current velocity can be expressed at any reference level below the surface, with currents speeds typically lessening with depth.
