description: Part of the sea state that has been remotely generated

#Swell
The swell part of a [sea state](?sea-state) refers to the waves that have been generated over a remote area and have subsequently propagated to the local area. Swell waves tend to have long periods, which increase with increased distance from the point of origin. Swell also has long organised crests. Swell waves do not whitecap and in deep water will have gentle faces.

The size of the local swell is dependent on the size at its origin and its distance of propagation.  A 'rising' swell occurs as the remotely generated waves start to arrive at the immediate location and will 'ease' once the largest waves have passed.

Through [spectral partitioning](?spectral-partitioning), the swell can be separated from other parts of the sea state and given specific quantitative values of [significant wave height](?significant-wave-height), [mean wave direction](?mean-wave-direction) and [peak period](?peak-period). There can be more than one swell partition at any given location, and this is common in large ocean basins, where waves from multiple remote storms can propagate to the local area.
