title: Tide

# Tide
Tides are caused by gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. Tides are very long-period waves that causes the rise and fall in sea level resulted from gravitational attraction of the moon and the sun. When the highest part, or crest, of the wave reaches a particular location, high tide occurs; low tide corresponds to the lowest part of the wave, or its trough. The difference in height between the high tide and the low tide is called the tidal range.
