# Model forecast charts
The map overlays show raw forecast model parameters. The overlays are a merged set of model grids from the MetOcean Solutions atmospheric and oceanographic model suite. Higher resolution grids will appear by default where they are available on zooming in.

The standard layers that can be selected are:
1. [Precipitation](?precipitation-rate) and [MSLP](?mean-sea-level-pressure)
2. [Wind 10 m above surface](?mean-wind-velocity)
3. [Wave height](?significant-wave-height)
4. [Peak wave period](?peak-wave-period)
5. [Air temperature](?air-temperature)
6. [Visibility](?visibility)
7. [Thunderstorm/squall risk](?thunderstorm-risk)
8. [Surface current](?current-velocity)
9. [Sea surface temperature](?sea-surface-temperature)

The images shown on the map correspond to the time selected in the map time control, as displayed at the top centre of the map.

All overlays are currently based on the modelling stack driven by the NOAA Global Forecast System (GFS). This include the GFS data itself, wave models forced by GFS winds and current models forced by GFS.
