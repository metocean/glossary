description: Estimated maximum wave height

#Maximum wave height
The maximum wave height ($$H~max~$$) is an estimate of the largest single wave that will occur in a particular [sea state](?sea-state). A common approximation is that the maximum wave is 1.86 times the [significant wave height](?significant-wave-height), which corresponds to the 1 in 1000 wave from a raleigh distribution.

For measured wave heights, the maximum wave height will be the single largest peak to trough excursion measured by the device.
